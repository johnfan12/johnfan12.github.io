Find A Peaceful Place

What's the meaning of travel? Sometimes I think, if I use the money to buy a new device, which I can enjoy a lot more time, will it be better?

Actually, I want to find the answer.I still CAN'T persuade myself yet. If I make decisions, I would kill many plans about travelling. Instead, buy an Ipad Pro or other useful but not really demanded devices. I can find pleasure in it. But if I will sleep in a broken hotel, tolerate much noise in bus and train, so, why we travel?

What the aim of this blog is not to find the answer about the topic now, just to point out the problem, when I get another idea, I'll update this blog about the topic.
